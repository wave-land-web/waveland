Their ability to guide us toward achieving our vision with both creative and technical expertise made creating our site a breeze. We had a very unique vision for the site that wasn't something we'd seen done before, and Wave Land made it look easy.",

Although Born Yesterday Bakery started off with font and colors in mind, Josh really took those small elements and ran with them. I get complimented on my website regularly. People love to use it! Also, Josh is an amazing listener/sounding board. He knows how to take my mess of an idea and turn it into something beautiful, cohesive & functional. Everything a website should be. I could not recommend Wave Land Web enough.',

He got me excited about my website, which not only affected how I branded myself for my online presence, but also influenced some of the ideas in my own research. Our work together connected so deeply to how I understand what I do, communicate it to others, and how I fundamentally do this work daily. I can't thank Josh and Wave Land enough!",
